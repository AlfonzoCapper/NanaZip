# Changelog

**NanaZip 1.0 Preview 1 (1.0.25.0)**

- Modernize the build toolchain with MSBuild for using MSIX packaging and 
  parallel compilation support.
- Use [VC-LTL 5.x](https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/VC-LTL5) toolchain to make the
  binary size even smaller than the official 7-Zip because we can use 
  ucrtbase.dll directly and the optimizations from modern compile toolchain.
- Add the context menu support in Windows 10/11 File Explorer.
- New icons and minor UI tweaks.
